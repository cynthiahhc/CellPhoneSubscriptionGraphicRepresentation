We're adding a new JPanel at the bottom of the 2 original panels as an instruction which specifies the steps the user should interact.
- The user click a country from the list first, the GraphView will leave the points for the country selected.
- The user then move the mouse (MouseEntered()) to the dot, and the dot will enlarge and show the (year, subscription).

We'll implement MouseInputListener on both GraphView and LegendPanel to accomplish the interaction with the user.
